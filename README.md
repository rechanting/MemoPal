# MemoPal
I created this bot originally to help me with memorizing text that I would need from a school club!

It saves the text you provide in a txt file then with any new text, its going to edit the txt file originally created, acting like a database!
This bot uses Gemini to compare the saved text and the recited text that you save and it will grade it. 
PLEASE BE AWARE IT MIGHT NOT ALWAYS BE ACCURATE.

To get started, head over to https://discord.dev/ to create your bot then go to https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey to get your gemini key.
